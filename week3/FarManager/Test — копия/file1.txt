I love those J-I-N-G-L-E bells
Those holiday J-I-N-G-L-E bells
All those happy J-I-N-G-L-E, B-E double L-S
I love those J-I-N-G-L-E bells
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Dashing through the snow (Rudolph)
In a one-horse open sleigh (today)
O'er the fields we go (Rudolph)
Laughing all the way (today)
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making our spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells,…
